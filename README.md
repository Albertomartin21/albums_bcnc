## Execution

### Compile
```
To compile the program and pass all the tests you must use:
-Gradlew clean build
```

### Run
```
And to run the program use:
-Gradlew bootRun
```

## Test
### Test application
```
Once the program has been started, to test the application you should test the api with postman: https://www.postman.com/
And use the path you have initialized the program with, which should be: http://localhost:8080/

To see the documentation of the apis you can check them in the swagger:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

I leave a collection of postman in the folder /postman
```
